`purchases.txt`: A file of dummy purchase data, generated programmatically.

Census Bureau data is freely available.  See, for instance:
* <http://www.census.gov/topics/population/genealogy/data/2000_surnames.html>
* <http://www.census.gov/topics/population/genealogy/data/1990_census/1990_census_namefiles.html>

The additional generated data (fake Social Security Numbers, birth dates, and
salaries) come from programs written by Brian Clapper; that data is public domain.
