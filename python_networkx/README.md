# Options for installation

### Option 1: Install Anaconda.

If you haven't installed Anaconda, go here: https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/ This will install everything that you need.

### Option 2: pip

If you don't want to install Anaconda, open the terminal and run the following commands:

- <code>pip install networkx</code>
- <code>pip install matplotlib</code>
- <code>pip install "ipython[all]"</code>
- <code>pip install oauth2</code>

# Options for running

### Option 1: IPython Notebook

If you have installed a distribution like Anaconda or Enthought, or if you pip installed from above, you have IPython notebook. To run IPython notebook and to follow along:

- git clone this repo OR download it as a zip and unzip it to your Desktop
- open the terminal/command line and cd into networkx-tutorial/notebooks
- in your terminal, type: <code>ipython notebook</code> 

### Option 2: Wakari.io

Wakari.io is a platform for web-based Python data analysis. It also allows you to host IPython Notebooks online and share them so people can run IPython Notebook in the browser. 

The caveat with this option is that Wakari doesn't work with the newest version of IPython notebook, so we were not able to upload the updated material. The material on Wakari, however, should be fairly similar to the current tutorial, minus a few small sections.

To sign up for Wakari:

- go here https://www.wakari.io/
- when you register, it might give you a message that "we're at capacity for this plan" or something. Ignore it and click on the Wakari logo in the top left corner.
- Then, click this link: https://wakari.io/sharing/bundle/sarguido89/twitter-networkx
- Click on "run/edit this notebook"
- It might say "404: Not Found". That's okay! On the left, double click on "notebooks", and then on the notebook you want to open.
- You might have to open, close, and reopen files several times to get them to open.

### Option 3: Follow along on the web

If none of these options work, or you just want to watch now and code later, you can follow along below. It's not interactive, but you'll be able to see what's happening.
